        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, My name is Samuel Thomas. I am a web developer specializing in
          website design and functionality. For many years I have been a
          basketball fan, I enjoy games as an audience member and on the court
          daily. Growing up in East bay California; I've spent countless hours
          on the beach and many mornings enjoying the many wonders of San
          Francisco.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love chess, Anime, and video games. Most of my days are spent with
          my brother; my family is very important to me! Most people that know
          me will tell you I am extroverted and make freinds easily. I am
          extremely tall (6 foot 9 to be exact). Contradictory to what my
          friends say though I like to think I the opposite. I've worked in many
          different professions and love to talk about them.
