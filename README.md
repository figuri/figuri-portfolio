### *-I made a Portfolio*

Using newly learned skills and applying no small amount of google fu I made a webpage to display the fruits of my labor. When you view the page you can see navigation links at the top that will take you to different corresponding points on the page. Also clicking on an image located in the projects section will take you to one of my other finished webpages.

### Complications Arise

During this not so short process; I ran into numerous roadblocks and had difficulty remembering key concepts.
below is an example of finished code I struggled with.

## **LEARN**

I learned alot about comprehensive logic when it comes to reading and understanding an ask in the software world. Many times I had to start over on a part or parts of code that I had gone wrong on and had to turn back and fix.

I also learned alot of syntax when it comes to css formatting and brushed up on some topics that I hadnt covered in some time.
